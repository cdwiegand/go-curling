# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please file it in the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/cdwiegand/go-curling/security/advisories/new) tab, describing how the code is vulnerable, and how to reproduce (if possible - an example command line demonstrating the vulnerability).

As this is not my full time or day job, I may take several days to respond - please feel free to raise an Issue should you not get an initial response within one week.
